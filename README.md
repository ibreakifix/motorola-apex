Misc reverse engineering stuff / expirements with the APEX EQAM platform.

The goal is to determine how the MediaCipher 2.1 ACP (access control processor / encryption ASIC) is personalized. This is likely going to be a waste of time. But we need to find a way to re-seed units that have had ACP batteries die, and there is no documented way to perform this repair without a seedload station. 

Shameless begging: If you see this and can lend a hand, please open an issue and get in touch :).
